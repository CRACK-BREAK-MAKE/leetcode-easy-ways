     * Problem: Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. Given the sorted rotated array
     * nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
     *
     * Intuition: Given it is sorted in ascending order but rotated meaning if we rotate 1 time then [a[0], a[1], a[2], .., a[n-2], a[n-1]]
     * becomes [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]
     *
     * In brute force approach I can iterate over the array till n - 2 and check if a[i] > a[i + 1] then return a[i + 1]
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)

     * The key insight is that in a rotated sorted array, there's a "pivot point" where the array wraps around. The minimum element
     * is exactly at this pivot point.
     *
     * Using Binary search we can exploit a key property, in a rotated sorted array, if you compare any element with the
     * rightmost element (nums[end]), you can determine which "side" of the pivot(rotation point) you're on.
     * If nums[mid] > nums[end], then mid is in the left portion (before the pivot), so the minimum must be in the right portion (including the pivot).
     * If nums[mid] â‰¤ nums[end], then mid is either the minimum or in the right portion (after the pivot), so the minimum must be
     * in the left portion (including mid).
     *
     * The key insight is comparing elements to determine which side of the "anomaly" (the pivot point) you're on, and then
     * eliminating the irrelevant half.
     * The reason nums[start] contains the minimum at the end is because our binary search specifically narrows down to the pivot point
     * where the smallest element is located. The loop terminates when start and end converge on this pivot point.
     *
     * Let's walk through Example 1: [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
     * Initial: start = 0, end = 6, mid = 3
     * nums[mid] = 7, nums[end] = 2
     * 7 > 2, so minimum is to the right: start = mid + 1 = 4
     * Next iteration: start = 4, end = 6, mid = 5
     * nums[mid] = 1, nums[end] = 2
     * 1 < 2, so minimum could be at mid or to the left: end = mid = 5
     * Next iteration: start = 4, end = 5, mid = 4
     * nums[mid] = 0, nums[end] = 1
     * 0 < 1, so minimum could be at mid or to the left: end = mid = 4
     * Next iteration: start = 4, end = 4 (loop terminates)
     * Answer: nums[start] = 0
     *
     * Now which binary search pattern to use,
     * 1. We need to narrow down the result instead of exact match of a target so we can use the "while(start < end)" pattern.
     * 2. Also we need to find the minimum element that means we can use the leftmost binary search pattern.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(log n)
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
     * @param nums
